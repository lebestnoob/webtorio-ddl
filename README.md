# Troubleshooting
* If you're unable to extract the downloaded zip file, try using [7-Zip](https://7-zip.org)
* If you are getting *Not Found* errors on a particular magnet link, try to view the torrent through the official site. If it works there, but not here, feel free to report the issue.
* Certain torrents do not download. The torrent files served by Webtor.io's API are invalid for the current parser
