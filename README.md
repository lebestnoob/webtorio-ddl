# Webtor.io DDL
Creates a zip file of a torrent through [Webtor.io's](https://webtor.io) hidden API

# Demo


# Troubleshooting
* If you're unable to extract the downloaded zip file, try using [7-Zip](https://7-zip.org)
* If you are getting *Not Found* errors on a particular magnet link, it likely means that the torrent is not available on Webtor.io's trackers.
* I'm looking for contributors. Certain files cannot be downloaded due to their filename. A better parser needs to be created. In the meantime, use Webtor's official website.
